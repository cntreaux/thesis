Observably, rammed-earth building is reappearing around building-related domains in the U.S.. It is predominantly visible about academia, professional architecture, and building industry. ``Rammed-earth"/``pis\'e de terre"/``tapia"/``h\=angt\v u" refers to an earthen building material formed by a mechanical process. The material and its formative method are semantically coupled. Rammed-earth's Wikipedia entry refers to it as a ``technique for constructing." It has archaeological, anonymous, and autochthonous roots in China, the Middle East, Africa, Old Europe, and other geographic epicenters \cite{RAMMEDEARTHHOUSE}.

\noindent Rammed-earth's contemporary tectonic in the U.S. is the subject of this thesis. Specifically, its model within the great current industrial momentum of the multi-layered assemblies of modernity vis-\`a-vis its great historical, physical, and thermodynamic inertia. \\


Marshall McLuhan noted (1964), with respect to media/technology, ``the medium is the message." Rammed-earth \textit{qua} rammed-earth conveys the socio-technical desire for a durable, economical, and sustainable form of building. This is not an unseen desire in the U.S.. For one instance, French architect Fran\c cois Cointereaux entertained Thomas Jefferson in 1789 with a model for durable rammed-earth structures suiting America's burgeoning rural economy, referring to ``the economical building art of the ancients, perfected and made more universal\footnote{\url{http://archive.is/yWexi}}." For a second instance, rammed-earth briefly held the attention of the New Deal-era Resettlement Administration as an economical building alternative during the Great Depression. For a third instance, rammed-earth captured marginal interest during the environmental movements of the 1960s and 1970s following recognition of adverse anthropogenic effects and the formal synthesis of sustainable development \cite{GARDENDALE}.







For instance, rammed-earth has been a vernacular form of architecture in rural China, it was presented to then-Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson by French architect Fran\c cois Cointereaux as ``the economical building art of the ancients, perfected and made more universal\footnote{\url{http://archive.is/yWexi}}," it briefly held the attention of the New Deal-era Resettlement Administration as an economical building alternative during the Great Depression \cite{GARDENDALE}, and it captured marginal interest during the environmental movements of the 1960s and 1970s \cite{GARDENDALE}. Critically, conceptual and technical developments from the traditional rammed-earth constitution drive a modernized rammed-earth industry and normalize similarly modernized rammed-earth homes, some valued in the multimillion-dollar range\footnote{\url{http://archive.is/K853p}}. As rammed-earth science/innovation/marketing/design/construction et cetera approach what could be called the mainstream in the United States, the Second Law is finally beginning to have its way with rammed-earth at its conceptual and technical cores.

``Contemporary stabilized rammed earth (SRE) draws upon traditional rammed earth (RE) methods and materials, often incorporating reinforcing steel and rigid insulation, enhancing the structural and energy performance of the walls while satisfying building codes. SRE structures are typically engineered by licensed Structural Engineers using the Concrete Building Code or the Masonry Building Code."}} \\ --- Bly Windstorm and Arno Schmidt. \\ \textit{A Report of Contemporary Rammed-Earth Construction and Research in North America}. 2013.

Contemporary technologies such as cement-stabilized, pre-insulated, and pre-fabricated walls---innovations currently driven by standard fixations on insulation, energy efficiency, and mass-production---disorder the coherence between the industrially-unprocessed material and its formative methodology. Apart from historic preservation, for which there is no positive heritage of rammed-earth building in America to preserve, it is hypothesized herein that this coherence of local material with localized building methodology is the key to rammed-earth's veritable sustainability (physically and conceptually enduring for millenia, while concurrently sustaining its respective inhabitants).

What follows is an attempt to rationalize and design a system of design that bridges rammed-earth's historical ability to sustain itself, its inhabitants, and the biosphere, with the contemporary mega-concept of sustainable development and mega-structure of building itself. Thermodynamics and computation are regarded as principal fields in which rammed-earth may be understood materially and methodologically, pre-architecturally and post-scientifically. Specifically, thermodynamics accounts for the physical flows of energy/matter involved in rammed-earth forms from the scale of physiological comfort to the scale of the biosphere as a planetary solar engine. Computation accounts for the collective analyses and syntheses of information necessary to realize rammed-earth structures in a scalable and secure manner.

No sooner is adjustment of one kind begun than the culture takes a further turn and forces the adjustment in a new direction. No adjustment is ever finished. And the essential condition on the process --- that it should in fact have time to reach its equilibrium --- is violated. This has all actually happened. In our own civilization, the process of adaptation and selection which we have seen at work in the unselfconscious cultures has plainly disappeared."}}\\ --- Christopher Alexander. \\ \textit{Notes on the Synthesis of Form}. 1964.
